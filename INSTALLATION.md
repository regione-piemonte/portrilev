# INSTALLATION (TODO)

## Local environment
- For the local development/testing environment, at least one AS instance is required. It is not strictly required to have more than one instance of the AS server.
- A proxy web server may be useful for JS development, by defining a proxy to the source directories. Depending on the AS server, the proxy may be configured on it (please refer to the documentation of the server for informations on how to do so).
- Compile the project PORTRILWEB and deploy the generated artifact on the AS instance
- Configure the DBMS via the scripts in the PORTRILDB project.

## Production environment
For the production environment, the same configuration for the local environment may be used.
